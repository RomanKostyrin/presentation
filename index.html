              Good day. My today's presentation about history of CSS. I want to
              start since 1991 at MIT. In that year young Hakon Wium Lie worked
              there. He worked with incredible device, who had 2k by 2k screen,
              unusual resolution.

              powers, all network connection to make it happen, but it didn't

              Instead the web was invented in Europe at CERN â€“ the cradle of the
              Web. In 1990 HTML was invented by Berners-Lee to create electronic
              pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web, each page contains
              a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.

              In 1994 Hakon joined Tim Berners-Lee's team. When he arrived he
              wokred on this computer - public web terminal. It was time - when
              students didn't have their own computers, not all of them

          <aside class="notes">
            This is screenshot from Mosaic - one of the first web browsers.
            Hakon said: It was incredible experience when you could start
            Mosaic, you could get a document up and you could see the blue text
            with underlined then you knew that it was a link, and you could
            click that link and you could be taken somewhere else to another
            computer, another part of the world, another document, that was just
            WoW! Then, when designers came to the web they saw this text and
            they said - wow, it looks bad! They wanted to have their favorite
            fonts and they wanted their colors, their typography. And they
            started to replace text with images. And it was a threat - you can't
            search some text in document - if this text - an image! it's hard
            for blind people - you can't use speech readers for this document.

          <aside class="notes">
            At that time Hakon decided that we need a little language, something
            to give the designers what they would like to have. He came up with
            CSS, it was just as simple as HTML, but it said something different,
            it didn't say anything about the structure of the document. Instead
            it says about presentation.

            Three days before Netscape announced the availability of its new
            browser, Hakon published the first draft of the Cascading HTML Style
            Sheets proposal. The initial CSS proposal was presented at the Web
            conference in Chicago in November 1994. In December 1996 CSS level 1
            emerged as a W3C Recommendation

          <aside class="notes">
            Among the people who responded to the first draft of CSS was Bert
            Bos. At that time, he was building Argo, a highly customizable
            browser with style sheets, and he decided to join forces with Hakon.
            Both of the two proposals look different from present-day CSS, but
            it is not hard to recognize the original concepts. One of the
            features of the Argo style language was that it was general enough
            to apply to other markup languages in addition to HTML. This also
            became a design goal in CSS and HTML was soon removed from the title
            of the specification. Argo also had other advanced features that
            didn't make it into CSS1, in particular, attribute selectors and
            generated text. Both features had to wait for CSS2.

              The next browser to announce support for CSS was Netscape
              Navigator, version 4.0. Since its inception, Netscape had been
              skeptical toward style sheets, and the company's first
              implementation turned out to be a half-hearted attempt to stop
              Microsoft from claiming to be more standards-compliant than
              Netscape.

              The third browser that ventured into CSS was Opera. The browser
              from the small Norwegian company made headlines in 1998 by being
              tiny (it fit on a floppy!) and customizable while supporting most
              features found in the larger offerings from Microsoft and
              Netscape. Opera 3.5 was released in November 1998, and supported
              most of CSS1.

              Hakon, was so impressed with Opera's technology that he joined the

              is mobile phones.
